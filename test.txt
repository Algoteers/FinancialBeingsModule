financial beings are autonomous agents
there is a relationship between a team and a financial being

so fb has creator, not an owner

team is the financial beings "owner" so to speak
team needs to find a way to fund a financial being

team members can make a clone of a financial being to modify it. one team has 10 FBs and 20 members. we want to take one
financial being and then fork it - start developing it further and improving it. when I'm done with it, i should be able to
merge it back and replace the original with the updated one.

teams own these financial beings and the team is the one putting it to competitions but the team members create

we aren't concerned with the team
